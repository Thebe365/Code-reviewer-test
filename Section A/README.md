## Positive aspects of the submission
This is a great submission overall. However, there are a few aspects of your code that need to be <br />
refined before the task can be marked as complete.

## Aspects of the submission that could be improved
Unfortunately, the code crashes when I attempt to run it. Take a look at line 6 as that is where the issue <br />
is raised.

Your code is too compact and is missing the necessary spacing and indentation which makes it hard to read. Your code should <br />
make use of descriptive variables which will make it much more readable.

Your code does not include any comments to explain the purpose or logic behind it. Documenting your work is a vital part of <br />
being a programmer as it helps other programmers who read your code be able to understand what your code does.

I've included a link below to resources that will guide you on how to properly style and document your code: <br />

## Overall feedback
Please attend to the issues that I have highlighted and I will happily take another look.
