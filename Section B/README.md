# Favourite Project
One of my favourite projects throughout the entire Bootcamp has to be the project <br />
management one. The reason why I chose this task is because of just how large and complex <br />
the task was. The whole task was the embodiment of everything that I have been learning for the past<br />
years on my journey of becoming a software engineer from OOP principles such as inheritance, data structures <br />
such as arrays and list, and sorting and searching algorithms such as quick sorting and linear search.
