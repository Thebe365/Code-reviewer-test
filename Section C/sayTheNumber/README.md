# Say the number
This is a Java program that converts an integer to a plain english word. The program prompts the user to enter <br />
any number which is then passed to the 'sayNumber()' method that handles the conversion. The conversion uses multiple <br />
if-else statements to recursively handle each number provided to it.

- JDK8
- JUnit 4
- An IDE (Eclpese/ Pycharm)
